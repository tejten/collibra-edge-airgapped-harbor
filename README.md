# Collibra Edge Air‑gapped Installation — Using Harbor Registry

Starter repository you can upload directly to GitHub. It mirrors the structure of your guide and includes:
- Markdown pages in `docs/` split by sections.
- Optional MkDocs site with search & nice navigation.
- GitHub Actions workflow to auto‑publish docs to **GitHub Pages**.
- Helper scripts (redacted) and a strict `.gitignore` for secrets.

> **Important:** Replace placeholders like `<TOKEN>`, `<PASSWORD>`, `<ROBOT_TOKEN>`, `<YOUR_DOMAIN>` before using. Never commit real secrets or private certificates.
